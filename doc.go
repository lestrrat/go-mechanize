package mechanize
/*

WARNING: EXTREME ALPHA QUALITY CODE

Package mechanize implements Perl5's WWW::Mechanize style HTTP client
that mimics a real web browser, in terms of resolving relative URLs
and such.

If you need a working tool right now, please check out surf
(https://github.com/headzoo/surf). This library exists because I had
some itches that I wanted to scratch.
